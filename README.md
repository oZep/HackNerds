HackHers 2024 Submission
## Inspiration
We understand that Zen and many other people use tools to regularly monitor their physical activities, but does it really motivate people to maintain healthy their habits? It's very easy for a person to see that they're unhealthy but not have the motivation to do anything about it. One way to incentivize more activity is to __dis__incentivize __in__activity. We wanted to create a product that doesn't let a user ignore when they've been inactive, and that's when we created the idea for the SHE

## What it does
The SHE (SHockingly Effective Motivational Tool) is a tool much like similar health monitors, but when one's heart rate and movement is below a certain threshold, they are deemed inactive and a small electric shock is given to the user.

## How we built it
Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Pulse Oximeter Sensor MAX30100/30102, Accelerometer GY-521 MPU-6050
