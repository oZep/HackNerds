## Challenge
This project is for Challenge 1 (Life Analyzer) and 2 (Movement Tracker):

## Inspiration
We understand that Zen and many other people use tools to regularly monitor their physical activities, but does it really motivate people to maintain healthy their habits? It's very easy for a person to see that they're unhealthy but not have the motivation to do anything about it. One way to incentivize more activity is to _dis_incentivize _in_activity. We wanted to create a product that doesn't let a user ignore when they've been inactive, and that's when we created the idea for the SHE.

## What it does
The SHE (SHockingly Effective Motivational Tool) is a tool much like similar health monitors, but when one's heart rate and movement is below a certain threshold, they are deemed inactive and a small shock is given to the user. The shock stops when the user becomes active. This is to motivate the user to always remain active and keep on moving!

## How we built it
To build this tool, we used an Arduino to code the program, Raspberry Pi for the bread board, Pulse Oximeter Sensor MAX30100/30102 to detect heart rate and Accelerometer GY-521 MPU-6050 and Gyrometer to measure movement.

## Challenges we ran into
Out team has conquered many challenges such as sensor wiring issues,
when we (Alae) fried our Pulse Oximeter Sensor MAX30100/30102,
and finding out that touching Vin and Ground on the heart rate sensor will lead to it shorting.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Despite all of us having very little to no experience with hardware, and despite us getting faulty hardware, we were able to complete a fully functional demo of our project.

## What we learned
How to use Arduino and program in Arduino code, how to communicate effectively as a team, how to connect multiple components to the Arduino.

## What's next for SHockingly Effective Motivational Tool (SHE)
- Ideally, the SHE will be able to connect to a users wrist and have it's own a power source so that it can be completely portable.

- Reduce the size of the componements so that it's comfortable to wear

- Add a Wrist Strap so that it can be worn on an wrist
  
- Improve the accuracy of the heart rate monitor to better detect whether or not the user is properly exercising

- Allow the user to choose the sensitivity of the motivational apparatus from simple vibration to more intense electrical stimulus
